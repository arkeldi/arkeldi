### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm Arkeldi, and Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge of software engineering by working on various projects shown below.

- ðŸ’¬ StarbucksPOS, is a project 4 other programmers and I worked on to develop a comprehensive Point of Sales (POS) system specifically designed for Starbucks. The focus of this project was on product/menu customization and sales tracking. To accomplish this, we leveraged product IDs to manage inventory and analyze employee performance effectively.
- To enhance the system's functionality, I developed and integrated backend RESTful APIs. This significant upgrade facilitated a seamless connection to the frontend user interface, thereby optimizing user experience. Further improvements to the user experience were made by incorporating accessibility features into the system, which included adjustable font size, contrast/brightness settings, and compatibility with screen readers.
- Throughout the project, we utilized Agile methodology and GitHub Projects, which proved highly effective for project management and task organization. This efficient management approach ensured that all tasks were completed timely and systematically, leading to the successful completion of the comprehensive POS system.

- ðŸ’¬ SoftwareMaterialSciences, is a project where I assembled a Python program which reads and stores data for multiple variables (DAQ (temperature), Display (temperature), and extensometer) while streamlining experiment values into a single file. I further analyzed/reported data using MATLAB/LabView explaining the performance of tested nickel based superalloy under various non-isothermal loading/testing conditions.


- ðŸ’¬ TCP/IP Enhanced IPC System, is a project that involves creating a system that can handle multiple request channels from the client, as well as accept connections from the client, read data from the client, and write data to the client, which is more complex than a simple three-way handshake. This project shows I understand TCP/IP protocol, which is critical for understanding how network attacks happen and how to prevent them.

- ðŸ’¬ MultiThreadedIPC: Enhanced Client-Server Communication, is a project that involves enhancing a previous client-server IPC implementation by adding multithreading to improve efficiency and runtime. By implementing multithreading to improve efficiency and runtime, I demonstrate an understanding of how system resources can be used effectively and safely.
  
- ðŸ’¬ Aggie Shell: A Comprehensive Linux Terminal, is a project that involves the creation of my own Linux shell that supports a variety of functions including basic commands, pipeline commands, file input/output redirection, multi-piped and redirection, background processes, and directory handling. This Linux shell illustrates my familiarity with Unix-like operating systems, which is very important for system administration and SWE roles.

- ðŸ’¬ ECGDataRetrieval: Client-Server Communication, is a project that involves a client-server architecture, where the client interacts with a server to obtain electrocardiogram (ECG) data of patients. The main operations include fetching individual data points and retrieving whole raw files of varying sizes. In this project, I am dealing with sensitive healthcare data, thus demonstrating an understanding of secure data transmission, a critical aspect in maintaining data privacy.

- ðŸ“« All of these projects I have worked on include thorough documentation and analysis of my work. 

- âš¡ Fun fact: My first name is combination of my Father's name, Arti, and my Mother's name, Enkelejda.
