I'm currently leading the development of a unique Discord bot for a club I am a part of, Aggie Competitive Programming Club.
This Discord bot is designed to add a fun, competitive edge to coding practice among our club members.

Thus, competitive coding practice quickly turns into an exciting duel game hosted on our ACPC Discord. 
It's not just about being correct; it's about being quick and efficient!

The GitHub repo contains all the code, diagrams of workflow and database, and documentation of the bot's framework.

Throughout my time at Texas A&M University, I often reach a crossroads with software engineering and cybersecurity which led me to gain experience in both topics. A few of my projects show my deep understanding of network security, system programming, and secure communication protocols.

For example, I built a custom Linux shell from scratch. I also implemented an extension of the IPC capabilities of the client-server implementation using TCP/IP protocol.

Starbucks POS was a fullstack project I worked on with 4 other programmers as part of building a Point of Sales system. 
Our SQL database was populated with tons of data, which directly interacted with the backend/frontend interface of our web app, hosted on Render. 

Our project and contributions were showcased in a formal presentation before classmates, teaching assistants, and our professor, ultimately earning us an 'A'.
