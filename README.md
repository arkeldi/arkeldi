I'm currently spearheading the development of a unique Discord bot for a club I am a part of, Aggie Competitive Programming Club.
This Discord bot is designed to add a fun, competitive edge to coding practice among our club members.

Thus, competitive coding practice quickly turns into an exciting duel game hosted on our ACPC Discord. 
It's not just about being correct; it's about being quick and efficient!

The GitHub repo contains all the code, diagrams of workflow and database, and documentation of the bot's framework.

Starbucks POS was a fullstack project I worked on with 4 other programmers as part of building a Point of Sales system. 

Our SQL database was populated with tons of data, which directly interacted with the backend/frontend interface of our web app, hosted on Render. 

Our project and contributions were showcased in a formal presentation before classmates, teaching assistants, and our professor, ultimately earning us an 'A'.
