# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

- ðŸ”­ I'm Arkeldi, and Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge of software engineering by working on various projects shown below.

- ðŸ’¬ StarbucksPOS is a project that four other programmers and I worked on to develop a comprehensive Point of Sales (POS) system specifically designed for Starbucks. The focus of this project was on product/menu customization and sales tracking. To accomplish this, we leveraged product IDs to manage inventory and analyze employee performance effectively.
- To enhance the system's functionality, I developed and integrated backend RESTful APIs. This significant upgrade facilitated a seamless connection to the frontend user interface, thereby optimizing user experience. Further improvements to the user experience were made by incorporating accessibility features into the system, which included adjustable font size, contrast/brightness settings, and compatibility with screen readers.
- Throughout the project, we utilized Agile methodology and GitHub Projects, which proved highly effective for project management and task organization. This efficient management approach ensured that all tasks were completed timely and systematically, leading to the successful completion of the comprehensive POS system.

- ðŸ’¬ Personal-Website is a project that involves a personalized webpage I created without BootStrap or any templates (from scratch!). The website includes some relevant information about me although it may be a little outdated. During the Chat GPT frenzy, I included a button in this website that changes the theme of the page to one generated by Chat GPT. As you can see, AI isn't quite there yetâ€”it still can't build aesthetically pleasing webpages from scratch!

- ðŸ“« Each project I've worked on includes thorough documentation and detailed analysis.

- âš¡ Fun fact: My first name is a combination of my father's name, Arti, and my mother's name, Enkelejda.
