### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**arkeldi/arkeldi** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge of cybersecurity by working on various projects.

- ğŸ’¬ ECGDataRetrieval: Client-Server Communication, is a project that involves a client-server architecture, where the client interacts with a server to obtain electrocardiogram (ECG) data of patients. The main operations include fetching individual data points and retrieving whole raw files of varying sizes. In this project, I am dealing with sensitive healthcare data, thus demonstrating an understanding of secure data transmission, a critical aspect in maintaining data privacy and integrity in cybersecurity.

- ğŸ’¬ Aggie Shell: A Comprehensive Linux Terminal, is a project that involves the creation of my own Linux shell that supports a variety of functions including basic commands, pipeline commands, file input/output redirection, multi-piped and redirection, background processes, and directory handling. This Linux shell illustrates my familiarity with Unix-like operating systems, which is very important for system administration and cybersecurity roles.

- ğŸ’¬ MultiThreadedIPC: Enhanced Client-Server Communication, is a project that involves enhancing a previous client-server IPC implementation by adding multithreading to improve efficiency and runtime. By implementing multithreading to improve efficiency and runtime, I demonstrate an understanding of how system resources can be used effectively and safely, an important consideration in securing systems.

- ğŸ’¬ TCP/IP Enhanced IPC System, is a project that involves creating a system that can handle multiple request channels from the client, as well as accept connections from the client, read data from the client, and write data to the client, which is more complex than a simple three-way handshake. This project shows I understand TCP/IP protocol, which is critical for understanding how network attacks happen and how to prevent them.

- ğŸ“« All of these projects I have worked on include thorough documentation and analysis of my work. 

- âš¡ Fun fact: My firt name is combination of my Father's name, Artur, and my Mother's name, Enkelejda.
